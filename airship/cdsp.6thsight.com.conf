# VirtualHost template
# Note: to use the template, rename it to /etc/apache2/vhost.d/yourvhost.conf. 
# Files must have the .conf suffix to be loaded.

# See /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2/README.QUICKSTART for further hints 
# about virtual hosts.

# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for requests without a known
